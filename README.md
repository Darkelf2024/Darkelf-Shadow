**Fully Hardened • Ephemeral • Zero-Trace Browser (Qt WebEngine / Chromium Core)**

Darkelf Shadow v4.5.9 is a defense-in-depth, privacy-hardened web browser engineered to eliminate persistent tracking, reduce attack surface, and actively defend against modern web threats — all while operating entirely in-memory.

---

## 🧱 HARDENED BY DESIGN

Darkelf Shadow is not just private — it is architecturally hardened:

### 🔥 Zero Persistence Architecture
- No disk-based session storage  
- Full memory-only browsing lifecycle  
- Automatic purge on process exit  

### 🛡️ Network-Level Enforcement
- Deep request interception layer  
- Pre-flight blocking before rendering  
- Third-party isolation logic  

### 🧠 Autonomous Threat Detection (MiniAI)
- On-device behavioral analysis  
- No cloud dependency  
- Real-time adaptive defense  

### 🚫 Telemetry-Free Core
- No analytics, tracking, or external communication  
- No hidden background services  

---

## 🚀 HARDENED FEATURE SET

### 🔐 Ephemeral Session Engine
- Memory-only:
  - Cookies  
  - Cache  
  - LocalStorage  
  - IndexedDB  
- No recovery artifacts  
- No session residue  

---

### 🧠 MiniAI Sentinel (Active Defense Engine)

Fully integrated on-device security AI:

#### 🚨 Intrusion Detection
- SQL Injection  
- XSS  
- Command Injection  
- Path Traversal  

#### 🦠 Detection Capabilities
- Malware / Exploit Detection  
- Tracker & Surveillance Detection  
- Fingerprinting Monitoring  
- Behavioral anomaly detection (burst/flood attacks)  

---

### ⚡ Automated Response Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|--------|
| 🟢 Standby | Passive monitoring |
| 🔴 Lockdown | Blocks all suspicious traffic |
| 🚨 Panic Mode | Full network shutdown |

---

### 🌐 Advanced Network Filtering
- ✔ EasyList / EasyPrivacy / uBlock filters  
- ✔ Regex-based ABP engine  
- ✔ Heuristic tracker detection  
- ✔ Hard-blocked known ad/tracker domains  
- ✔ Third-party request classification  

---

### 🔍 Anti-Tracking & URL Sanitization
Removes:
- utm_*  
- fbclid  
- gclid  
- Tracking campaign parameters  

Prevents cross-site tracking correlation  

---

### 🔐 HTTPS Enforcement Layer
- Automatic HTTP → HTTPS upgrade  
- HSTS-like memory tracking  
- Downgrade attack prevention  

---

### 🎭 Fingerprint Resistance Layer
MiniAI actively detects and neutralizes:

- Canvas fingerprinting → Noise injection  
- WebGL → Spoofed output  
- AudioContext → Sanitized  
- Fonts → Obfuscated  
- WebRTC → Disabled  
- Geolocation → Blocked  

---

### 📥 Secure Download Isolation
- Sandboxed download directory  
- Randomized filenames (anti-forensics)  
- Optional ephemeral storage  
- No metadata leakage  

---

### ⚙️ Chromium Hardening Flags

Disabled by default:

- ❌ Sync services  
- ❌ Metrics collection  
- ❌ Crash reporting  
- ❌ First-run tracking  

---

## 🧩 DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH MODEL

Darkelf Shadow combines multiple security layers:

- Request Interception Layer  
- Filter Engine (EasyList + Heuristics)  
- MiniAI Behavioral Analysis  
- Fingerprint Protection  
- Ephemeral Storage Model  

Each layer operates independently and reinforces the others.

---

## 🧪 THREAT INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITIES

MiniAI provides:

- 📊 Threat scoring system  
- 📈 Real-time event monitoring  
- 🧠 Domain risk caching  
- 📋 Detailed threat reports  
- 🔄 Adaptive escalation logic  

---

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS

- ⚙ Built on PySide6 + Qt WebEngine  
- 🚀 Chromium rendering engine  
- 🧠 In-memory operations (minimal disk I/O)  
- ⚡ Fast startup, clean shutdown  

---

## 🔒 SECURITY POSTURE SUMMARY

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Persistence | ❌ None |
| Telemetry | ❌ None |
| Tracking Resistance | ✅ Strong |
| Fingerprint Defense | ✅ Active |
| Threat Detection | ✅ Real-time |
| Network Control | ✅ Enforced |

---

## ⚠️ OPERATIONAL SECURITY NOTES

For maximum protection, combine Darkelf Shadow with:

- 🔐 Full-disk encryption (FileVault, LUKS)  
- 🔥 OS-level firewall rules  
- 🧱 Sandboxed runtime environment  
- 🌐 Trusted VPN or network isolation
