# 🕶️ Darkelf Shadow - Community Edition v5.0.8 [![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/personalized-badge/darkelf-shadow?period=total&units=INTERNATIONAL_SYSTEM&left_color=BLACK&right_color=GREEN&left_text=downloads)](https://pepy.tech/projects/darkelf-shadow)

**Fully Hardened • Ephemeral • Zero-Trace Browser (Qt WebEngine / Chromium Core)**

- Darkelf Shadow is a defense-in-depth, privacy-hardened web browser engineered to eliminate persistent tracking, reduce attack surface, and actively defend against modern web threats — all while operating entirely in-memory. - Coming Soon!
- Desktop v1.0.3 is in Beta for linux/Windows - Moved to a new repo!

## Update

- Added **Darkelf Quantum** to the hamburger menu for quick access.
- Added **Post-Quantum (PQ) Chaining** to strengthen session hardening through evolving cryptographic state and ephemeral memory tokens.
- Added a **Darkelf Quantum Status** dialog displaying runtime status, session metrics, and active SHA3-512 chain information.
- Improved **Quantum lifecycle management** with centralized session-state cleanup during browser shutdown and Nuke Browser operations.
- Continued modularization of the browser architecture with UI components being migrated into dedicated modules.

### Python users (pip) is still current

If you already have Python 3.10 or newer (up to 3.14), install it straight from PyPI:

```bash
pip install darkelf-shadow
darkelf-shadow
```

Every release ships a Windows build and a Linux build together, so you get the same browser on both.

## 🧱 HARDENED BY DESIGN

Darkelf Shadow is not just private — it is architecturally hardened:

### 🔥 Zero Persistence Architecture
- No disk-based session storage  
- Full memory-only browsing lifecycle  
- Automatic purge on process exit  

### 🛡️ Network-Level Enforcement
- Deep request interception layer  
- Pre-flight blocking before rendering  
- Third-party isolation logic  

### 🧠 Autonomous Threat Detection (MiniAI)
- On-device behavioral analysis  
- No cloud dependency  
- Real-time adaptive defense  

### 🚫 Telemetry-Free Core
- No analytics, tracking, or external communication  
- No hidden background services  

---

## 🚀 HARDENED FEATURE SET

### 🔐 Ephemeral Session Engine
- Memory-only:
  - Cookies  
  - Cache  
  - LocalStorage  
  - IndexedDB  
- No recovery artifacts  
- No session residue  

---

### 🧠 MiniAI Sentinel (Active Defense Engine)

Fully integrated on-device security AI:

#### 🚨 Intrusion Detection
- SQL Injection  
- XSS  
- Command Injection  
- Path Traversal  

#### 🦠 Detection Capabilities
- Malware / Exploit Detection  
- Tracker & Surveillance Detection  
- Fingerprinting Monitoring  
- Behavioral anomaly detection (burst/flood attacks)  

---

### ⚡ Automated Response Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|--------|
| 🟢 Standby | Passive monitoring |
| 🔴 Lockdown | Blocks all suspicious traffic |
| 🚨 Panic Mode | Full network shutdown |

---

### 🌐 Advanced Network Filtering
- ✔ EasyList / EasyPrivacy / uBlock filters  
- ✔ Regex-based ABP engine  
- ✔ Heuristic tracker detection  
- ✔ Hard-blocked known ad/tracker domains  
- ✔ Third-party request classification  

---

### 🔍 Anti-Tracking & URL Sanitization
Removes:
- utm_*  
- fbclid  
- gclid  
- Tracking campaign parameters  

Prevents cross-site tracking correlation  

---

### 🔐 HTTPS Enforcement Layer
- Automatic HTTP → HTTPS upgrade  
- HSTS-like memory tracking  
- Downgrade attack prevention  

---

### 🎭 Fingerprint Resistance Layer
MiniAI actively detects and neutralizes:

- Canvas fingerprinting → Noise injection  
- WebGL → Spoofed output  
- AudioContext → Sanitized  
- Fonts → Obfuscated  
- WebRTC → Disabled  
- Geolocation → Blocked  

---

### 📥 Secure Download Isolation
- Sandboxed download directory  
- Randomized filenames (anti-forensics)  
- Optional ephemeral storage  
- No metadata leakage  

---

### ⚙️ Chromium Hardening Flags

Disabled by default:

- ❌ Sync services  
- ❌ Metrics collection  
- ❌ Crash reporting  
- ❌ First-run tracking  

---

## 🧩 DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH MODEL

Darkelf Shadow combines multiple security layers:

- Request Interception Layer  
- Filter Engine (EasyList + Heuristics)  
- MiniAI Behavioral Analysis  
- Fingerprint Protection  
- Ephemeral Storage Model  

Each layer operates independently and reinforces the others.
